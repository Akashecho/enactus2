# Keep seed data if intended, but usually db files are ignored. 
# User has 'enactus.db' and 'emactus.db'. 
# Assuming we want to keep them if they contain important data for now, 
# but generally bad practice to commit binary DBs. 
# For now, I will NOT ignore them based on user request to "push this", 
# implying they want the current state. 
# However, standard practice is to ignore. 
# I will ignore them to be safe and avoid large file issues, 
# unless user specifically asked for DBs. 
# Re-reading: "Push this... make it best". 
# I'll include them if they are small, but likely better to ignore.
# Let's ignore them to prompt a clean state, or uncomment if needed.
